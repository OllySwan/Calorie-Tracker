# Calorie-Tracker

<h2>End of year project 👨‍💻 2020/2021</h2>

This is my mobile web developemnt end of year submission, I built a simple calorie tacker web app that makes use of the MVC design pattern. The app allows the user to view their daily calorie intake, add to the total, and reset the total... there are a few other features however tracking calories is the focus.

Technologies/Languages I used are as follows...
* C#
* CSS
* HTML
* Bootsrap
* Visual Studio 2019
 
There is a lot I would like to imporove on in the project like making the front end **much more appealing** to the eye but there was time constraints I had to adhere to.
